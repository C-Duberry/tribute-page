                    <h3>1950</h3>
                    <h2 id="earlylife">Early Life</h2>
                    <p>Born in 1950 in South Carolina to Carl and Pearl McNair, Ronald was raised in a climate
                        of racial segregation. Growing up, McNair was a very studious child who could read and write before entering school.
                        His love of space began after the Soviet launch of Sputnik, the first space satellite and boosted by watching
                        <em>Star Trek.</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        McNair's determination began when he was a small child. At nine years old, he attempted to check
                        out books from  a segregated library and refused to leave, even when the librarian threatened to call the
                        police. The librarian called the police and McNair's mother. McNair sat on the counter and waited for them to arrive.
                        When they eventually arrived, the police officer asked the librarian asked why she can't just give the kid the books.                  
                        Eventually, the librarian handed them over and McNair thanked her. The building that housed the library is
                        now named after him.

                    <p>
                        McNair was an outstanding student and shone in baseball, basketball and football. He also loved
                        playing the saxophone for his school band. He graduated as valedictorian of the class of 1967 and was
                        awarded a scholarship to North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University (NC A&T) where
                        he achieved a B.S. in physics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        McNair continued his education at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he
                        studied for a PhD. He faced a major challenge during his studies when two years of research on laser physics for
                        his doctorate was stolen. Nonetheless, McNair produced a second set of data and earned his PhD in 1976. He then
                        went on to study in France with a focus on laser physics. His novel research findings were published in several scientific
                        papers. At this point, NcNair was a recognised expert in the field of chemical and high-pressure lasers.

                    <p>In the same year McNair graduated, he married his wife, New York, native Cheryl Moore. They then
                        relocated to in Malibu, California so McNair could pursue a career as a physicist at Hughes Research
                        Laboratories in Malibu, California. During McNairâ€™s time as a staff physicist he worked on the development of lasers for
                        isotope separation and conducted research on electro-optic modulation for satellite space communications

                        McNair and his wife went on to have children, son Reginald, born in 1982, and daughter Joy, born
                        in 1984.

                    <p>
                        McNair was one of 10,000 applicants who applied to NASA's astronaut program. In January 1978,
                        NASA selected him and handful of 35 others to join the program. Disaster nearly struck when he was seriously injured
                        in a car accident but McNair's determination saw him persevere. By the following august, he had completed his training
                        and evaluation.

                        Guion S. Blueford was the first African American in Space and about five months later, Ronald
                        McNair followed as the second. McNair worked as a mission specialist on the Challenger as part of a successful mission,
                        which orbited the earth 122 times and launched $75 million communications satellites.

                    <p>Nearly two years after his first mission, in January 1986, McNair set out to join a crew of seven
                        as one of three mission specialists on board the Challenger. As the public tuned in to watch the flight climb to
                        space, the challenger shuttle exploded and began to disintegrate only 73 seconds into its flight, killing all crew members on board.

                        McNair left behind his wife and two children. McNair was originally buried at Rest Lawn Memorial Park. In 2004,
                        his remains were moved to Ronald E. McNair Memorial Park which was also in Lake City, South California.

                        Ronald McNair was an accomplished jazz saxophonist and was the first astronaut to play a musical
                        instrument in space. For his doomed second mission, McNair had plans to play a saxophone solo
                        piece for composer Jean Michel Jarre's album, Rendez-Vous. Jarre paid tribute to McNair by
                        entitling the album's last piece, Last Rendez-Vous (Ron's Piece) - 'Challenger'.
                    </li>
                    <li> Ronald McNair was a Karate expert. He won the 1976 AAU Karate gold medal and went on to win
                        five regional championships, later becoming a fifth-degree black belt Karate Instructor.</li>
                    <li>On January 29, 2011, the library in Lake City, South Carolina was dedicated to the Ronald McNair
                        Life History Center.</li>
                    <li> McNair logged 191 total hours in space with his first mission aboard the Challenger. He and his
                        crew achieved many firsts, including the first untethered spacewalk.</li>

                    <li>With his McNair 1984 space mission, McNair became the second African American to fly in space,
                        after Dr. Guy Blueford who flew a year earlier.
